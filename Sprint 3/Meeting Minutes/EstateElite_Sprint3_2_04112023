Minutes:

    Penoelo was assigned to create a function on the back-end to change the status state of an offer to accepted or declined. Additionally, was assigned to create a function that deletes an offer from the database.
    Nabih was assigned to work on the "my offers" page and connect it to the backend once Penoelo creates the function on the back-end.

    Penoelo finished his work on the back-end which allowed Nabih to connect the app to the database and display the offers. Penoelo also addded the delete function on the back-end.
    Nabih tested the "my offers" page and then, started creating a temporary Offer Management page for brokers.
