Agenda:

    Work on frontend and backend to complete our assigned task 
        - Discuss how we would do to retrieve the offers and display them
        - Write a quick pseudo code to have an idea how to start
        - Start working on the front-end
        

Minutes:

    It was discussed that the offers would be displayed using the following logic: 
        - first fetch the offers element from the database and save the property IDs of each offer in an array
        - Then by itarting through the property IDs arrray, we fecth the corresponding property
        - Then once, the property is fetched, we can gather its data and then display it

    That logic was then implemented by Nabih on the front-end, with the assistance of Peno. 

    Penoelo was assigned to start working on the back-end to create a get function that would retrieve the offer elements.
    Nabih was assigned to finish the "my offer" page so it can be connected to the database on the next meeting.
